# automated_install

Our full integration test is run via [tests/automated_install.sh](./tests/automated_install.sh). The following user-modifiable settings are available:
* BACH_CLUSTER_PREFIX -- supply a string to supply as a prefix to all hosts in the VM cluster, this making host names unique and allowing multiple VM clusters to coexist on a single hypervisor
* BOOTSTRAP_VM_MEM -- Quantitiy of memory to offer the bootstrap (infrastructure) VM
* BOOTSTRAP_VM_CPUs -- Quantitiy of virtual CPU's to offer the bootstrap (infrastructure) VM
* CLUSTER_VM_MEM -- Quantitiy of memory to offer each cluster VM
* CLUSTER_VM_CPUs -- Quantitiy of virtual CPU's to offer each cluster VM
* CLUSTER_TYPE -- The cluster type to build: `Hadoop` or `Kafka`

The automated_install process has the following workflow:
1. Copy stub files into a cluster directory (NOTE: this lives one directory below the Git repository in a directory called `cluster`)
2. From our [vbox_create.sh](./vbox_create.sh) library
    1. `download_VM_files` -- necessary Vagrant files to start bootstrap VM
    2. `create_bootstrap_VM` -- start-up and install the bootstrap VM to have a working Chef, PXE-boot server
    3. `create_cluster_VMs` -- build each VirtaulBox VM and all virtual networks for our VM installation
    4. `install_cluster` -- this largely runs our [boostrap_chef.sh](./bootstrap_chef.sh) script and coarsely verifies success:
        1. `rsync`'s the repositories files to the bootstrap VM (including the `cluster` directory of Chef environment, roles and cluster.txt)
        2. Runs our [build_bins.sh](./build_bins.sh) script which:
            1. Downloads and installs ChefDK on the bootstrap VM
            2. Run's the [bach_repository](./cookbooks/bach_repository/README.md) cookbook
        3. Runs our [setup_chef_server.sh](./setup_chef_server.sh) script which:
            1. Adds a local apt repository created by `build_bins.sh`
            2. Installs the Chef client Debian package from the loacl repository
            3. Installs the Chef server Debian package from the loacl repository
            4. Configures `/etc/chef-server/chef-server.rb`
            5. Copies the `vagrant` user SSH `authorized_keys` file to `root`'s
        4. Runs our [setup_chef_cookbooks.sh](./setup_chef_cookbooks.sh) script which:
            1. Creates and populates our `~vagrant/chef-bcpc/.chef/knife.rb` file
            2. Runs Berkshelf to populate `~vagrant/chef-bcpc/vendor/cookbooks`
        5. Uploads the Chef cookbooks, environment and roles to the Chef Server
        6. Runs our [setup_chef_bootstrap_node.sh](./setup_chef_bootstrap_node.sh) script which:
            1. Creates the bootstrap VM Chef client and node objects (and makes it a Chef admin)
            2. Runs `recipe[`[`bcpc::apache-mirror`](./cookbooks/bcpc/recipes/apache-mirror.rb)`]`
            3. Runs `recipe[`[`bcpc::chef_vault_install`](./cookbooks/bcpc/recipes/chef_vault_install.rb)`]`
            4. Runs `recipe[`[`bcpc::chef_poise_install`](./cookbooks/bcpc/recipes/chef_poise_install.rb)`]`
            5. Runs `role[`[`BCPC-Bootstrap`](./stub-environment/roles/BCPC-Bootstrap.json)`]`
            6. Runs `recipe[`[`bach_repository::apt`](./cookbooks/bach-repository/recipes/apt.rb)`]`
3. Then we populate inital Gems from our [GEMFILE](./GEMFILE) using `bundler`
4. We snapshot all VM's at this point in snapshot `Shoe-less`
5. See further steps under the [Snapshots](#Snapshots) section

## Snapshots
Snapshots are created as the system is setup to allow for rolling back to the last successful step for one to try a modification and re-run. Snapshots are:
### Pre-Basic
This snapshot is once the cluster VM's have been provisioned by Vagrant -- no Chef objects have been created for them yet.
### Post-Basic
This is after the `cluster-assign-roles.sh <environment> basic` operation has completed. No Hadoop components should be installed at this stage. Initial OS configuration and Chef object creation is all that should have been done at this phase.
### Post-Bootstrap
This is after the `cluster-assign-roles.sh <environment> bootstrap` operation has completed. Here Hadoop head nodes have been setup. However, no services are yet usable. This is a shim-step to allow us to go directly into an HA HDFS cluster without having to go through an intermediate non-HA HDFS deployment.
### Post-Install
This is after the `cluster-assign-roles.sh <environment> <cluster type>` operation has completed. Here all services have been deployed and should be running on all VM's.

# Tests
There are many tests in Chef-BACH. We have unit-tests, functional tests and integration tests -- yet as with all codebases we don't have enough tests! Here's how to run some of our tests:

This process is to run tests using ChefDK. It is also possible to run using purely Gems potentially too. (Some day we will even have a Rakefile for all this...)

## Rspec/ChefSpec
* Run the following on the bootstrap VM or install necessary Debian packages to install all necessary Gems (e.g. mysql, augeas, etc.)
* `export PATH=/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin:$PATH`
* `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:/usr/share/pkgconfig`
* `cd ~vagrant/chef-bcpc`
* `source proxy_setup.sh`
* `bundler exec rspec`
* `for c in cookbooks/*; do pushd $c; bundler install --path $(pwd)/vendor/bundle --without cookbooks && bundler exec rspec || echo "Failed in $c" 1>&2 ; popd; done`

## Test-Kitchen
* `export PATH=/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin:$PATH`
* `kitchen verify`
* `for c in cookbooks/*; do pushd $c; kitchen verify || echo "Failed in $c" 1>&2 ; popd; done

## Integration Tests
Run `tests/automated_install.sh` for both `Hadoop` and `Kafka` cluster types
